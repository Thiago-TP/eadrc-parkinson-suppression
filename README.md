# EADRC Parkinson's Tremor Suppression

This repository studies tremor suppression in a 3-DOF biomechanical arm model by comparing several control strategies under parameter uncertainty. The codebase is organized around a simulation workflow: define the model, run multiple stochastic realizations, and then summarize the resulting trajectories with post-processing metrics and plots.

## Project goals

- Model a human arm as a 3-joint system with nominal parameters and sampled stiffness uncertainty
- Compare multiple suppression strategies against the same baseline conditions
- Save simulation outputs to a reproducible results directory
- Generate summary plots and metrics tables after the simulations finish

## Model and configuration

The nominal arm parameters and uncertainty ranges are defined in [configs.yaml](configs.yaml). This file contains:

- geometric and inertial parameters for the shoulder, elbow, and wrist dynamics
- stiffness values and stiffness intervals for Monte Carlo-style sampling
- initial conditions for the joint states

The main model logic is implemented in [src/system.py](src/system.py), and the top-level simulation driver is [src/main.py](src/main.py).

## Control strategies in the current codebase

The active simulation entry point currently instantiates and runs multiple controller variants, including:

- AFE notch filtering
- EADRC with EBMFLC
- EADRC with ZPLP
- Gallego PI
- PID controllers
- uncontrolled baseline

The exact controller implementations live under [src/control_strategies](src/control_strategies).

## Getting started

### 1. Create an environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

The project declares dependencies in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) and includes a pip-compatible list in [src/requirements.txt](src/requirements.txt).

```bash
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

If you prefer the package metadata workflow:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Run the simulations

The simulation entry point expects to run from inside the [src](src) directory because the scripts import modules directly from that folder.

```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

This executes the configured control strategies across the nominal model and additional sampled-stiffness cases. Results are written under [results/runs](results/runs).

## Output files

The workflow writes numerical outputs and then post-processes them.

### Simulation outputs

The generated run files live in [results/runs](results/runs). These are the primary numeric artifacts used to compare controllers and amplitudes.

### Post-processing

From the repository root, or from within [src](src), run:

```bash
cd src
python postprocessing/postprocess.py
```

This script reads the saved run files and generates summary plots and metrics under:

- [results/plots](results/plots)
- [results/metrics](results/metrics)

## Notes on the workflow

- The simulation driver in [src/main.py](src/main.py) accepts `num_simulations` and `amplitude_voluntary` parameters.
- The configuration file drives both the nominal model and the uncertainty sampling ranges for robustness analysis.
- This repository is organized as a research/simulation project rather than a packaged application, so the source directory is the primary execution context.

## CBA 2026 paper and presentation

This work is the subject of the paper *Error-Based Active Disturbance Rejection Control for Parkinson's Disease Tremor Suppression in Wrist Considering Upper Limb Dynamics*, presented at the XXVI Congresso Brasileiro de Automática (CBA 2026, the Brazilian Congress on Automation), held in São Paulo, Brazil, on October 6–9, 2026. More information about the conference is available at [sites.usp.br/cba2026](https://sites.usp.br/cba2026/).

- [cba-2026-paper](cba-2026-paper) holds the LaTeX sources of the paper, written with the `ifacconf` class of the conference template: sections, tables, figures, references, and the reviewers' comments with the authors' answers to them (in Portuguese).
- [cba-2026-presentation](cba-2026-presentation) holds the Beamer slides of the 15-minute oral presentation, in Portuguese, built on the official CBA 2026 template (`cba2026.sty`). The slides reuse the paper's figures, upper limb schematic and bibliography straight from [cba-2026-paper](cba-2026-paper), so both folders must be kept side by side.

Both documents are built with a TeX distribution that provides `pdflatex`, `bibtex` and `biber` (e.g. TeX Live), from Git Bash or any other bash shell:

```bash
bash cba-2026-paper/build.sh          # writes cba-2026-paper/paper.pdf
bash cba-2026-presentation/build.sh   # writes cba-2026-presentation/presentation.pdf
```

Each script reruns `pdflatex` until citations and cross-references settle, prints any errors or warnings left in the log (no output means a clean build), and removes the auxiliary files.
